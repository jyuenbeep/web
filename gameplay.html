    <h1> Gameplay </h1>
    <p> The gameplay is classic RPG style, with a gacha system as well, that involves "pulling"
    different characters using in-game currency, with different rarities of the characters as well.
    The game also has a storyline concept, with many story elements incorporated into quests and
    NPC dialogues. Different characters also have different elements, with the seven being
    Hydro, Electro, Cryo, Pyro, Anemo, Dendro, and Geo.
    </p>
    <p> The main lore comes in the form of quests called "archon quests"
    and seperate character side stories are called "story quests", which you
  can unlock with a key, obtained by doing commisions. Daily commisions
reward players with primogems, which is the currency used to "pull" different
characters. Quests also give rewards as well; not just the archon and story
quests, but the side quests obtained from NPCs too.</p>
