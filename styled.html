<h3> Gameplay </h3>
<p> The gameplay is classic RPG style, with a gacha system as well, that involves "pulling" 
different characters using in-game currency, with different rarities of the characters as well.
The game also has a storyline concept, with many story elements incorporated into quests and
NPC dialogues. Different characters also have different elements, with the seven being
Hydro, Electro, Cryo, Pyro, Anemo, Dendro, and Geo.

<h3> Parties </h3>
<p> On the topic of characters, you can also form a party with up to four characters
with which you fight mobs and bosses with. My team consists of: Childe (a five-star 
Hydro character), Barbara (a four-star Hydro character), Razor (a four-star Electro 
character), and lastly, Bennett (a four-star Pyro character).
